<!-- Lucille wants to be able to create, read, update, and delete restaurants.

- Lucile wants to be able to create, read, update, and delete items.

- Lucille wants to be able to organize items by their restaurant (so an item should only belong to one menu).

- Lucille wants her app to "shine" visually.

- Lucille definitely wants the app to only have on view. No reloads!

- Finally, she wants a button to an About 'page' that has some information about you, since you are developing the application. -->

<!-- Visual organization is big for this app. Justin, a line cook, is all about Semantic UI . J.C., Sous Chef, is a fan of Skeleton CSS, because it provides a smaller grid.

Lucille wants some elements on the page to "pop", and catch the eye of the user. Joey, a dishwasher, used to rely heavily on jQuery animations, but now uses smaller, lighter CSS3 animations with a great library called Animate CSS -->
